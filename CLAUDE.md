## UI rules

**NO TOOLTIPS. EVER. Unless I explicitly ask for one in that specific request.**

- Never add a `title=` attribute to an element. macOS renders it as a hover bubble.
- Never add a hover-reveal label, popover label, or `group-hover:` text bubble.
- Never install or reach for a tooltip library (Radix, shadcn, react-tooltip, tippy,
  floating-ui). This repo has none — keep it that way.
- Do not add tooltips "for accessibility" or "for discoverability." If a control needs
  explanation, the answer is a better icon, a visible label, or nothing — not a tooltip.
- `title` as a *prop* on `ConfirmModal` / `Section` / `InlineOption` is a visible heading.
  That's fine and unrelated.
